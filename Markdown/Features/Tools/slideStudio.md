# Slide Studio

Slide Studio is a built-in tool that allows the quick creation of presentations and keynotes, all from a single prompt. Instead of making a PowerPoint, just write a prompt. Use AI to craft 10-minute presentations in just 5 minutes.

To access Slide Studio, click the `Toolbox` button, then click `Slide Studio`.

## Creating a Presentation

Write a prompt about your presentation's topic.

Example prompts:
> Generate a presentation about nucleic acids and how it carries our genetic code.
> 
> Generate a presentation about the causes of the Renaissance.

To support your presentation with context or domain specific knowledge, enable web search by clicking the `Web Search` button. Additionally, you can drag a file into the prompt bar to add it.

When you are ready to create your presentation, hit `Return`. Slide generation will begin.

## Previewing and Editing a Presentation

When presentation generation is complete, a preview of the slides is displayed alongside an editor.

You can edit the slides by directly editing the Markdown on the left. The preview on the right will update in real-time to reflect your changes.

To generate a new presentation, click the `New Slides` button on the top right. To exit Slide Studio, click the `Exit` button in the toolbar.
