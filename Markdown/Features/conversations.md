# Conversations

Conversations in Sidekick are the basic grouping unit for a series of related messages with the chatbot.

## Working with Messages

### Copying Message Content

To copy the content of a message, click the copy button above the message content. This will copy the content to the clipboard with Markdown formatting applied to the text.

To copy the raw message content with Markdown formatting syntax, click the three dots next to the copy button, then select `Copy Raw Markdown`.

### Read Response

To read Sidekick's response out loud, click the speaker button above the message content. Sidekick will read the response out. If you want to stop, click the speaker button again.

To change the voice used, go to `Settings` -> `Chat` -> `Voice` and select a voice.

## Reasoning Model Support

Sidekick supports a variety of reasoning models, including Alibaba Cloud's QwQ-32B and DeepSeek's DeepSeek-R1.

Click the purple header labeled `Reasoning Process` to hide and show the reasoning process.

When using hybrid reasoning models such as Qwen3, reasoning can be toggled on/off. As you type your prompt, Sidekick automatically analyses it and determines if reasoning is needed. To explicitly toggle reasoning, click the `Reason` button in the prompt bar.

## Advanced Markdown Rendering
