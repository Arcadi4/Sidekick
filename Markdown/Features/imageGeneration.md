# Image Generation

Sidekick can generate images from text, allowing you to create visual aids for your work. 

There are no buttons, no switches to flick, no `Image Generation` mode. Instead, a built-in CoreML model **automatically identifies** image generation prompts, and generates an image when necessary.

Image generation is available on macOS 15.2 or above, and requires Apple Intelligence.
