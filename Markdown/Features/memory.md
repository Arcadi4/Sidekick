# Memory

Sidekick can now remember helpful information between conversations, making its responses more relevant and personalized. Whether you're typing, speaking, or generating images in Sidekick, it can recall details and preferences you’ve shared and use them to tailor its responses. The more you use it, the more useful it becomes, and you’ll start to notice improvements over time.

For example, I might tell Sidekick that I am a beginner in Python trying to create my own version of Tetris.

When I ask it about `pygame` alternatives, it makes recommendations based on my current project, Tetris.

## Using Memory

As an experimental feature, Memory is turned off by default. To turn on `Memory`, navigate to `Settings` -> `Retrieval`, then toggle `Use Memory` to on.

## Remember

Sidekick stores details from your conversations without explicit action. When it finds and stores a useful tidbit, the label `Memory updated` will be displayed to the upper right of the assistant's message.

Click on the label, then select `Forget` to make Sidekick forget this memory. Alternatively, click `Manage Memories` to view and manage all memories.

## Recall

Sidekick recalls and uses memories automatically in conversations. For example, here, it recalls that I am working on building a variant of Tetris, and comments on `pygame` alternatives in the context of my project.
