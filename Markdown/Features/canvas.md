# Canvas

Canvas allows you to collaborate with Sidekick on writing and coding tasks that require more than just a conversation. It launches parallel to your chat, enabling you and Sidekick to work together on a project. This represents a fresh approach to collaboration –– building and enhancing concepts with AI.

When using Canvas, Sidekick gains deeper insight into your objectives. By selecting particular areas, you can guide Sidekick on which parts to apply changes. Akin to an editor or reviewer, it provides targeted feedback and recommendations, keeping the whole project in perspective.

## Text and Code

Press the 3D-cube button in the right hand side of the toolbar to open Canvas. Editable content will be automatically extracted from the text and displayed. Code will automatically open in Canvas by default.

By selecting specific ranges of the text, you can instruct Sidekick to apply changes to that range only. 

To switch between different versions of the text, select a version from the bottom of the Canvas editor by clicking `v1`, `v2`, etc.

To export the text, click the share icon to copy the text, or click the copy icon to copy the text with formatting applied.

## Websites

When HTML, CSS and JS code is detected in the chatbot's response, it is automatically extracted and displayed in Canvas.

Just like text and code, you can select a version from the bottom of the Canvas editor by clicking `v1`, `v2`, etc.

You can export the completed site by clicking the share icon, then setting the desired output location.

## Example Use

Since Canvas works with references, you can use it to create interactive charts to visualize your data!

Drag your data source (e.g. an Excel spreadsheet) into the prompt bar, then tell Sidekick to `Make a website to show this data with an interactive bar chart.`
