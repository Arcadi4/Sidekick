# Detector

Detector is a built-in tool that helps you find out how much of a text was generated by AI. Use Detector to evaluate the AI percentage of text, and rewrite AI content following provided suggestions. To avoid exposing private work, Detector is only available if a local LLM is configured in Settings.

To access Detector, click the `Toolbox` button, then click `Detector`.

# Analyzing a Text

Paste the text you want to analyze into the editor, then click the `Analyze` button in the toolbar.

When analysis is complete, an inspector automatically opens alongside your text, with an `AI Probability` and sentences driving human and AI probability respectively.

Click the `Edit` button to edit and submit your text for re-evaluation. To exit Detector, click the `Exit` button in the toolbar.
